To use the nano syntax highlighting install qc.nanorc somewhere and
add:

include /directory/qc.nanorc

to your nanorc file located at ~/.nanorc. If the file doesn't exist
create it.

Optionally you can install it globally by installing qc.nanorc to
/usr/share/nano

However you still need to provide the include to your ~/.nanorc
