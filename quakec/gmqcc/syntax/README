Here exists some syntax highlighting configuration files for various
text editors. Inside each directory exists some documentaiton on how
you can install the configuration file correctly.

Currently the supported text editors:
    geany
    kate
    kwrite        - uses kate syntax highlighting
    kdevelop      - uses kate syntax highlighting
    QtCreator     - supports kate syntax highlighting
    gtksourceview - main source viewer in GNOME
    gedit         - uses gtksourceview
    sandy         - uses gtksourceview
    nano
    jedit


Other text editors we plan to provide syntax highlighting configuration
files for (but never got around to figuring out)
    vim
    emacs

If your text editor is not supported and you'd like to create syntax
highlighting support for it, don't hesitate to share it with us.
