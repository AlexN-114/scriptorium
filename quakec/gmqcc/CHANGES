Release 0.3.5:
    * Preprocessor:
        - Added warning for when preprocessor directives are used in
          a macro.
    * Language:
        - Added vector bit operations.
        - Added vector cross product operator `><` for -std=gmqcc.
        - Added `[[eraseable]]` and `[[accumulation]]` attributes.
        - Removed &~= operator for -std=gmqcc.
        - #pragmas which are ignored are actually ignored to EOL.
    * Compilation:
        - Fixed constant folding.
        - Fixed column printing in diagnostics.
        - Added support for columns in LNOF.
        - Shadowed locals fix.
        - Improved warning diagnostics for precedence usage and other
          various diagnostics.
        - Added constant folding logic for builtin functions.
        - Prevent divide by zero in constant folding.
        - Added unary elision optimization, cases where a unary expression
          cancels itself out, e.g `-(-a)` now simplifies to `a`.
        - Added strength reduce optimization, for divisions e.g `(A / 10)`
          now strength reduces to `(A * (1 / 10)` where `(1 / 10)` is
          evaluated at compile time.
        - Added superfluous expression elision optimization, e.g `(A + 0),
          (A - 0), (A * 1), (A / 1)` can be simplified to just `A`.
        - Quake world now compiles with -std=qcc
        - Constant folding for `if than` now works for ternary expressions
          too.
        - Fixed `[[alias]]` attribute type checking, now you can't alias
          invalid types.
    * QCVM:
        - Properly exits on error now.
    * Lexer:
        - Now prints the character the lexer fails on instead of the
          token value.
    * Testsuite:
        - Important fixes to the testsuite (removal of false positives
          and false negitives).
        - Added a new utility `check-proj.sh` which downloads various Quake
          mods and attempts to compile them.
    * Commandline:
        - Made -fshort-logic, -funtyped-nil and -fvariadic-args default
          for -std=gmqcc.
    * Build:
        - Generate PDFs of man documents for Windows releases.
        - Archlinux/Archbsd package now generates MTREE.
    * Documentation:
        - Fixed mdoc(s).
    * Misc:
        - Added some export scripts for xonotic and nexuiz which generate
          specially crafted packages that are used by the check-proj script.

2013-08-20 v0.3.0
    * Language:
        - Return assignments, the ability to assign to the return keyword
          as if it were a local variable.
        - Added bitwise XOR operator (^)
        - Array initializers: e.g float a[] = {1, 2, 3};
        - Fix bug that dissalowed language operators to be used in strings.
    * Compilation:
        - Optimized memory usage (now uses on average %3 less memory for
          compilation).
        - Fixed dotranslate (translatable strings)
        - Rewrote constant folding optimization pass for the parser.
        - New additional dead-code-elimination-consatant-fold pass for
          if statements whos expression can be evaluated at compile-time
          (allowing the if/else branch to be entierly elided at compile-time).
        - Added support for columns in error diagnostics.
        - Limit corrector to <= 16 byte strings.
        - Improved hash function for hashtable (old hash function had 15% error,
          this speeds up compilation)
        - Improved performance of in-house allocator with branch-hinting, speeds
          up compilation of Xonotic by 3 seconds!
    * QCVM:
        - Escape strings for -printdefs
    * Commandline:
        - Added statistic dumps, gives information about the number of used
          hashtables, vectors, and number of unique sizes of vectors and
          hashtables. The amount of memory used for vectors. As well as the
          number of strdups used in total for compilation.
        - Added compile statistic dumps, gives information about the compiled
          binary, and LNO, such as the size, CRC, the number of times a
          specific optimization was applied, etc.
        - Make -std=qcc default.
    * Testsuite:
        - Fixed a floating point exception rasied by modulo operation in
          -memchk.
        - Added support for the test-suite to source tests and task-template
          files from subdirectories in the test/ directory.
        - Now prints the number of failed tests (if any) after all tests
          are attempted.
        - Fixed some bugs with error handling resulting in false-positives.
    * Build:
        - Can now be compiled with TCC (Tiny C compiler) and function as
          intended (previously couldn't due to bug in TCC codegen).
        - Added Gentoo ebuilds.
        - Added Win32 Makefile for building Win32 packages.
        - Added Slackware pkg build files.
        - Added Fedora spec files.
        - Added Makefile for the BSD make variant.
    * Misc:
        - Added valgrind memcheck hook to in-house allocator to help aid
          in finding invalid reads/writes, and more accurate leaks.
