To use the ebuilds provided in this gentoo directory you first must
create a directory in your overlay tree.

If you don't already have your own directory for custom ebuilds, you can
create one. If you already have one, and that directory is set in your
/etc/make.conf for PORTDIR_OVERLAY, this step can be skiped. Otherwise
if you don't already, you can create one as such.

# mkdir -p /usr/local/portage
# vim /etc/make.conf
	Set PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage
	Then save and exit

Once that is completed, or you skiped that step, you need to create a
directory in your overlay tree for gmqcc, this can be done as such:
(subsitute [[PORTDIR_OVERLAY]] with the one set in /etc/make.conf)

# mkdir -p [[PORTDIR_OVERLAY]]/gmqcc

After the directory is created you need to move the correct version ebuild
into that directory depending on which version of GMQCC you want. For
instance, if you want gmqcc 0.3.0, you move gmqcc-0.3.0.ebuild into that
directory.

# mv gmqcc-{version}.ebuild [[PORTDIR_OVERLAY]]/gmqcc/

After the file is moved into your newly created portage overlay tree, you'll
need to build a digest for it with ebuild. A digest is simply a Manifest and
digital signature for the source files used.

# ebuild gmqcc-0.3.0.ebuild digest

After the digest is built, you can emerge gmqcc as usual.

# emerge gmqcc
