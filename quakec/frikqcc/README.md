Frikqcc
=======

This is essentially a repo for cleaning up the code for the *Frik QuakeC Compiler/Decompiler*. 

The path of the repo may change along the way, it depends.

How to compile
==============

You will need to install [premake4] (http://industriousone.com/premake/download) to your workstation to be able to generate a file that will aid you in compiling both the compiler and decompiler.
