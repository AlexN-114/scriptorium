Lily is a language that can be used to make dynamically-generated content in a way similar to PHP. It can also be run by itself.

Key features include:
* Static typing, with type inference inspired by Scala.
* All variables must always have a value (nil and NULL do not exist)
* Enum classes and variants (to allow for user-creation of an Option kind of type)
* Parameteric Polymorphism
* Lambdas, with support for type inference
* Any value can be passed to a function called show to reveal the contents
* User-declarable classes

Lily is inspired by C++, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Rust.
