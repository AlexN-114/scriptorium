# Lily allocates bytecode for functions from a buffer that uses offsets. This
# helps to reduce memory usage by reducing unnecessary buffer growing.
# This verifies that jumps patch to the right places. If they do not, then this
# will crash.

# This part is important: Something has to be in the buffer before 'f' is used
# so that there's an offset to work with.
