SyntaxError: Cannot assign type 'function (integer)' to type 'function (integer, *integer)'.
Where: File "optarg_type_narrow.lly" at line 18

define f(a: integer) {  }

define g(a: integer, b: *integer=10) {  }

# This causes h to have f's type.
var h = g

# This doesn't work. Math can be used to explain:
# g wants 1-2 types. It can handle optional arguments.
# f wants 1 type.
# Internally, this doesn't work because pushing too many args onto a
# function not preprared for it does bad things to the stack.
h = f
